In this unit conversion program, you can convert any amount of one unit to another.

When you start the program, you will be brought to the main menu, where you will be asked to choose from the following options:
1. Length
2. Mass
3. Time
4. Temperature

To make your selection, you must enter the corresponding number.

Depending on your choice, you will then be shown one of the following four menus:

For length:
1. Inches
2. Feet
3. Yards
4. Miles
5. Millimeters
6. Centimeters
7. Meters
8. Kilometers

For mass:
1. Ounces
2. Pounds
3. Tons
4. Milligrams
5. Grams
6. Kilograms

For time:

2. Minutes
3. Hours
4. Days
5. Weeks
6. Months
7. Years

For temperature:
1. Kelvins
2. Degrees Celsius
3. Degrees Fahrenheit

Here you will be asked to choose the unit you would like to start with.

After making your choice, you will then be asked to enter how many of that unit you wish to convert. You may enter any number.

Next, you will be shown the same menu of units again and asked which one you would like to convert your starting units to.

Finally, you will be shown the result of the conversion.

For example, if you choose centimeters, then enter 2.54, and then choose inches, you will get the following result:
2.54 centimeters = 1 inch.

After being shown your result, you will then be returned to the main menu.

To exit the program, simply enter "quit" or "Quit" at the main menu.

Please note that some conversions may be approximations, due to exact conversion between certain units being virtually impossible.
